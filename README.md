# <img src="/assets/logo.svg" alt="logo" width="30"> HiRewards

HiRewards is a lightweight plugin that gives custom rewards when players greet a joining player with things like "welcome" or "hello!" The plugin aims to build a strong community by encouraging your player base to greet both new and returning players. The plugin is designed as a very supplementary and unintrusive cousin of the various "chat games" plugins out there.

## Features
- Custom rewards (compatible with any economy plugin)
- Different rewards for greeting new players & greeting returning players
- Custom trigger words (**supports regex**)
- Custom response window intervals
- Custom cooldown intervals
- Anti-exploit system

### Planned Features
- [ ] Welcoming streak (with increasing rewards)
- [ ] DiscordSRV integration
- [ ] ~~Fabric port (not planned, nor is any other port)~~
